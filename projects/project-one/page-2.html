        So now to come to the real question of punctuation, <span class="period">.</span><span class="word">periods</span>, <span class="comma">,</span><span class="word">commas</span>, <span class="colon">:</span><span class="word">colons</span>, <span class="semicolon">;</span><span class="word">semi-colons</span> and capitals and small letters.

        I have had a long and complicated life with all these.
        <br>
        <br>  
        Let us begin with these I use the least first and these are <span class="colon">:</span><span class="word">colons</span> and <span class="semicolon">;</span><span class="word">semi-colons</span>, one might add to these <span class="comma">,</span><span class="word">commas</span>.

        When I first began writing, I felt that writing should go on, I still do feel that it should go on but when I first began writing I was completely possessed by the necessity that writing should go on and on and if writing should go on what had <span class="colon">:</span><span class="word">colons</span> and <span class="comma">,</span><span class="word">commas</span> to do with it, what had <span class="period">.</span><span class="word">periods</span> to do with it what had small letters and capitals to do with it to do with writing going on which was at that time the most profound need I had in connection with writing. What had <span class="colon">:</span><span class="word">colons</span> and <span class="semicolon">;</span><span class="word">semi-colons</span> to do with it what had <span class="comma">,</span><span class="word">commas</span> to do with it what had <span class="period">.</span><span class="word">periods</span> to do with it.

        What had <span class="period">.</span><span class="word">periods</span> to do with it. Inevitably no matter how completely I had to have writing go on, physically one had to again and again stop sometime and if one had to again and again stop sometime and if one had to again and again stop some time then <span class="period">.</span><span class="word">periods</span> had to exist. Beside I had always like the look of <span class="period">.</span><span class="word">periods</span> and I liked what they did. Stopping sometime did not really keep one from going on, it was nothing that interfered, it was only something that happened, and as it happened as a perfectly natural happening, I did not believe in <span class="period">.</span><span class="word">periods</span> and I used them. I really never stopped using them.
