        Beside that  <span class="period">.</span><span class="word">periods</span> might later come to have a life of their own to commence breaking up things in arbitrary ways, that has happened lately with me in a poem I have written called Winning His Way, later I will read you a little of it. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp By the time I had written this poem about three years ago  <span class="period">.</span><span class="word">periods</span> had come to have for me completely a life of their own. They could begin to act as they thought best and one might interrupt 
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp one’s writing with them that is not really interrupt one’s writing with them but one could come to stop arbitrarily stop at times in one’s writing and so they could be used and you could use them.  <span class="period">.</span><span class="word">Periods</span> could come to exist in this way and they could come in this way to have a life 
<br>
<br>
of their own. They did not serve you in any servile way as  <span class="comma">,</span><span class="word">commas</span> and  <span class="colon">:</span><span class="word">colons</span> and  <span class="semicolon">;</span><span class="word">semi-colons</span> do. Yes you do feel what I mean.
<br>
<br>
<span class="period">.</span><span class="word">Periods</span> 
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp have a life of their own a necessity of their own a feeling of their own a time of their own. And that feeling that life that necessity that time can express itself in an infinite variety that is the reason that I have always remained true to  <span class="period">.</span><span class="word">periods</span> so much so that as I say recently I have felt that one could need them more than one had ever needed them.
<br>
<br>
You can see what an entirely different thing a  <span class="period">.</span><span class="word">period</span> is from a  <span class="comma">,</span><span class="word">comma</span>, a  <span class="colon">:</span><span class="word">colon</span> or a  <span class="semicolon">;</span><span class="word">semi-colon</span>.
