    There are two different way of thinking about <span class="colon">:</span><span class="word">colons</span> and <span class="semicolon">;</span><span class="word">semicolons</span> you can think of them as <span class="comma">,</span><span class="word">commas</span> and as such they are purely servile or you can think of them as <span class="period">.</span><span class="word">periods</span> and then using them can make you feel adventurous I can see that one might feel about them as <span class="period">.</span><span class="word">periods</span> but I myself never have, I began unfortunately to feel them as a <span class="comma">,</span><span class="word">comma</span> and <span class="comma">,</span><span class="word">commas</span> are servile they have no life of their own they are dependent upon use and convenience and they are put there just for practical purposes. <span class="semicolon">;</span><span class="word">Semi-colons</span> and <span class="colon">:</span><span class="word">colons</span> had for me from the first completely this character the character that a <span class="comma">,</span><span class="word">comma</span> has and not the character that a <span class="period">.</span><span class="word">period</span> has and therefore and definitely I have never used them. But now dimly and definitely I do see that they might well possibly they might have in them something of the character of the <span class="period">.</span><span class="word">period</span> and so it might have been an adventure to use them. I really do not think so. I think however lively they are or disguised they are they are definitely more <span class="comma">,</span><span class="word">comma</span> than <span class="period">.</span><span class="word">period</span> and so really I cannot regret not having used them. They are more powerful more imposing more pretentious than a <span class="comma">,</span><span class="word">comma</span> but they are a <span class="comma">,</span><span class="word">comma</span> all the same. They really have within them deeply within them fundamentally within them the <span class="comma">,</span><span class="word">comma</span> nature. And now what does a <span class="comma">,</span><span class="word">comma</span> do and what has it to do and why do I feel as I do about them. </div>
