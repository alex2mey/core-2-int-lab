    As I say <span class="comma">,</span><span class="word">commas</span> are servile and they have no life of their own, and their use is not a use, it is a way of replacing oneâ€™s own interest and I do decidedly like to like my own interest my own interest in what I am doing. A <span class="comma">,</span><span class="word">comma</span> by helping you along holding your coat for you and putting on your shoes keeps you from living your life as actively as you should lead it and to me for many years and I still do feel that way about it only now I do not pay as much attention to them, the use of them was positively degrading. Let me tell you what I feel and what I mean and what I felt and what I meant.

    When I was writing those long sentences of The Making of Americans, verbs active present verbs with long dependent adverbial clauses became a passion with me. I have told you that I recognize verbs and adverbs aided by prepositions and conjunctions with pronouns as possessing the whole of the active life of writing.

    Complications make eventually for simplicity and therefore I have always liked dependent adverbial clauses. I have like dependent adverbial clauses because of their variety of dependence and independence. You can see how loving the intensity of complication of these things that <span class="comma">,</span><span class="word">commas</span> would be degrading. Why if you want the pleasure of concentrating on the final simplicity of excessive complication would you want any artificial aid to bring about that simplicity. Do you see now why I feel about that simplicity. Do you see now why I feel about the <span class="comma">,</span><span class="word">comma</span> as I did and as I do.
