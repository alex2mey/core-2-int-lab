    <h2>Response to: <span class="title">A Vernacular Web</span> by <span class="author">Olia Lialina</span></h2>

        While reading A Vernacular Web I found the point that web design in the 90s and the early 2000s was very collaborative quite interesting. I didn’t think of the fact that people making websites had no foundation to build on for web design and had to rely on others creations and building on each others work. The ubiquity of early of design was quite shocking to me, especially with the continually copied Mobile Telecom site design made by Artemy Lebedev. It was just very interesting to see how far the aesthetic and technical aspects of web design has changed in such a short amount of time, especially with the way many of the aspects of design like the caution signs, stopped being used in the name of “professionalism.” I wonder how fast things could change in the next 20-30 years.

    <h2>Response to: <span class="title">My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?</span> by <span class="author">Laurel Schwulst</span></h2>
    <time></time>
    <p>
        I feel like my viewpoint on the internet and websites has shifted slightly after reading Laurel Schwulst’s piece. I never thought of the metaphor of internet being a cloud very much. But as Schwulst continued to give metaphors of what websites and the internet is like made shifted my perspective on it all. I also liked the quote they included from George Lakoff and Mark Johnson’s Metaphors We Live By, and emphasizing how the web should be seen as a collaboration and collection of works and not as a singular unit.

        This article was interesting to me as I learned more about the connection and more solid establishment of digital typography. I learned what WYSIWYG was, and how that and the development as laser printers enabled more reliable digital typography and printing. Like last the last readings I tend to forget that there was a period of time where things that seem so trivial or things I never thought of was something that was at the forefront of innovation and progress. I also found the conversation on fonts and designs that utilized pixels was quite interesting too.

    <h2>Response to: <span class="title">The Webs Grain</span> by <span class="author">Frank CHimero</span></h2>
    <time></time>
    <p>
        I really enjoyed the metaphor Chimero used for responsive web design. Introducing David Hockney’s work with the array of singular images that don’t make sense on their own, but create a piece that work well together was a perfect analogy for creating something like a responsive website. I think it changed my view where now I feel like I can think of it more as a collection of different assets that require each other to make one piece, one website, rather than a predetermined piece that I would have to go back and piece together with the different puzzle pieces. I think that at times I can worry too much on what I want a final piece to look like that I forget that the most important this is that the different parts of the whole need to marry and work well with each other for the whole piece to work well, and not planning in a way that is part-focused goes against that way of thinking.
