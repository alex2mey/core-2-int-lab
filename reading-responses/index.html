    <h2>Response to: <span class="title">A Vernacular Web</span> by <span class="author">Olia Lialina</span></h2>
    <time></time>
    <p>
        While reading A Vernacular Web I found the point that web design in the 90s and the early 2000s was very collaborative quite interesting. I didn’t think of the fact that people making websites had no foundation to build on for web design and had to rely on others creations and building on each others work. The ubiquity of early of design was quite shocking to me, especially with the continually copied Mobile Telecom site design made by Artemy Lebedev. It was just very interesting to see how far the aesthetic and technical aspects of web design has changed in such a short amount of time, especially with the way many of the aspects of design like the caution signs, stopped being used in the name of “professionalism.” I wonder how fast things could change in the next 20-30 years.

    <h2>Response to: <span class="title">My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?</span> by <span class="author">Laurel Schwulst</span></h2>
    <time></time>
    <p>
        I feel like my viewpoint on the internet and websites has shifted slightly after reading Laurel Schwulst’s piece. I never thought of the metaphor of internet being a cloud very much. But as Schwulst continued to give metaphors of what websites and the internet is like made shifted my perspective on it all. I also liked the quote they included from George Lakoff and Mark Johnson’s Metaphors We Live By, and emphasizing how the web should be seen as a collaboration and collection of works and not as a singular unit.

    <h2>Response to: <span class="title">Title</span> by <span class="author">Author Name</span></h2>
    <time></time>
    <p>
        This article was interesting to me as I learned more about the connection and more solid establishment of digital typography. I learned what WYSIWYG was, and how that and the development as laser printers enabled more reliable digital typography and printing. Like last the last readings I tend to forget that there was a period of time where things that seem so trivial or things I never thought of was something that was at the forefront of innovation and progress. I also found the conversation on fonts and designs that utilized pixels was quite interesting too.

    <h2>Response to: <span class="title">The Webs Grain</span> by <span class="author">Frank Chimero</span></h2>
    <time></time>
    <p>
        I really enjoyed the metaphor Chimero used for responsive web design. Introducing David Hockney’s work with the array of singular images that don’t make sense on their own, but create a piece that work well together was a perfect analogy for creating something like a responsive website. I think it changed my view where now I feel like I can think of it more as a collection of different assets that require each other to make one piece, one website, rather than a predetermined piece that I would have to go back and piece together with the different puzzle pieces. I think that at times I can worry too much on what I want a final piece to look like that I forget that the most important this is that the different parts of the whole need to marry and work well with each other for the whole piece to work well, and not planning in a way that is part-focused goes against that way of thinking.

    <h2>Response to: <span class="title">Black Gooey Universe</span> by <span class="author">American Artist</span></h2>
    <time></time>
    <p>
        I found this reading really interesting. If I understood it properly, I found it really thought provoking how the author compared how Blackness is the foundation that many white people in tech used to get to the top positions they dominate in. The white people have used Blackness to create “echo chambers” of their own ideals at the top of the tech pyramid. I think comparing that to the black GUI / gooey in tech, and the lcd screen how blackness in a physical sense in screens is the base for whiteness and other colors was a great comparison. It makes me remember how most things we use and enjoy, were most likely built on some form of exploitation. It is sad to think that many forms of innovation in the past and even in the present were built off o the hard and exploited work of others that will not get credit or recognition for their work. The spoils of their work, especially in the US, will most likely go towards a white figurehead.

    <h2>Response to: <span class="title">Function as Narrative</span> by <span class="author">Weiyi Li</span></h2>
    <time></time>
    <p>
        This reading is really interesting to me as I always hear and think about the relationship of form and function in design and I never really gave too much thought to the nuances in the conversation. I found it thought provoking how the author talks about how you cannot say that form and function is not related, but at the same time, the function the designer designs for the form is not always going to be what the user will use the thing for. This was exemplified in this quote: “Form follows FUNCTION predefined by designer, but user can accept, reject or develop this prefabricated FUNCTION.” I also like how they always kept the word function in all caps too, it is something very simple when just thinking about it, but it was quite impactful with the whole message of the reading.

    <h2>Response to: <span class="title">Can the Internet be Archived?</span> by <span class="author">Jill Lepore</span></h2>
    <time></time>
    <p>
        I thought this essay was interesting as I never tend to give much thought towards the information on the internet, and the storing of that information. I found the opening of the piece quite interesting as the saying that if you post something on the internet, that it’ll be there forever, is something I was told all the time as a child. I was always told about this sense of immortality that was present within the internet. I didn’t realize how that conversation is not so exact. I found the conversation about the Internet Archive, and the Wayback Machine, quite interesting. Especially as it was inspired and compared with the Library of Alexandria. Something that is somewhat mythical in a sense as its a story people are told but are never able to confirm or deny. But here we have in real life in the present, a form of an archive with much of the information and things that have been posted in the world present. But at the same time I also found it interesting when Lepore talked about how the internet itself is a constant present. Since I was always raised with the idea that the internet is archival in nature, when it truly is more inherently present than it is reflective of the past, as Lepore supports with the existence of broken links and deleted pages.

    <h2>Response to: <span class="title">Data Feminism / Collect, Analyze, Imagine, Teach</span> by <span class="author">Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren Kleine</span></h2>
    <time></time>
    <p>
        I found this reading quite interesting. It reminded me of the Black Gooey Universe reading. Specifically on the topic of race in tech. I think it was interesting to start the reading off with the mapping of the death of black kids killed by white people on this specific intersection. I think the conversation on how minorities in America, specifically black communities here have so much pushed against them. I found this quote quite interesting: “Who makes maps and who gets mapped? The redlining map is one that secures the power of its makers: the white men on the Detroit Board of Commerce, their families, and their communities.” The reading also expands on racism in tech with how, even though the white people in power would like to convince us otherwise, there are racial prejudices seen throughout so many aspects as tech, and like the reading talks about, algorithms are the same. Algorithms contain data that have been collected with factors effected by racism, making the algorithm have the prejudices present in its processing. Like the other reading stated too, the bias of a designer will always be present within the creation, especially by the white people who make up the highest positions in tech.
