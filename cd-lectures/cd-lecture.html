    <h2>Lecture 1 <span class="title"></span> by <span class="author">Elaine Lopez</span></h2>

    <p>
        This lecture was interesting to me as I also had always heard the term decolonization in relation to bringing your culture into design. I never really questioned it until I listened to Elaine Lopez’s lecture. The idea that it is not decolonizing as it was not colonized in the first place is a simple thought that I had never truly thought about before. Instead what many artists and designers have been calling decolonization is actually just us implementing our own cultures in our work. This is something I have been trying to do more and more with my work here, partially because I do miss home and being surrounded by Indonesian culture.

    <h2>Lecture 2 <span class="title"></span> by <span class="author">Lynn Kiang</span></h2>

    <p>
        I found this lecture quite interesting. I enjoyed when Lynn Kiang talked about the project she made about the history of women’s suffrage. I thought it was really interesting all. Of the different ways she visualized statistics about women in government and women in positions of power. I feel like the visualization really would put into perspective for people how underrepresented women are in US government. I also enjoyed hearing her talk about the process she went through to coming to this finalized project. I enjoyed seeing the different sketches and explorations that were thought of before the final project came to be. I also enjoyed hearing her talk about her journey into the Design field and the path she took out of college with a psychology degree.
